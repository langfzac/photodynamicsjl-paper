## Markov Chain Monte Carlo
This directory contains the code to run the Affine Invariant and NUTS MCMC analysis of both the 2-planet and TRAPPIST-1 systems, and create Figure 11.

Note: The corresponding synthetic data must exist in the the `inference/` main directory. E.g. to run `hmc_T1.jl`, `synthetic_data_T1.jld2` must exist.

### TRAPPIST-1 (Section 5.2.4):
Assuming the `synthetic_data_T1.jld2` file exists, we run the 2 MCMC analyses in the following way: \
`julia --project hmc_T1.jl` \
`julia --project ainv_T1.jl`\
Both assume 8 CPU cores, which can be changed at the top of each script.

### Multi-planet (Section 5.2.3)
In order to run MCMC for N planets, simply generate the corresponding synthetic data (see parent directory), and modify the `nplanet` variable in `hmc_T1.jl` and `ainv_T1.jl`. 

Figure 11 is generated by running: \
`julia --project plots.jl`\
The 'data' used to generate the figure is hard-coded as the timing depends on the particular results for the above MCMC runs. After running HMC and AInv for each N planet system (N=2,3,4,5), modify the following variables in `plots.jl`:\
`cpu_time_ai` : CPU time in minutes for the Affine Invariant runs \
`nsamples_ai` : Total number of samples per chain for each AInv run \
`cpu_time_nuts` : CPU time in minutes for NUTS
