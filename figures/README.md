# Figures

The subdirectories contain the code for each figure in the text. The `common.jl` file contains functions used to generate figures. 

`bigfloat/`: Figure 5: bigfloat vs. double float precision test.

`compare_photodynam/`: Figures 6, 7, and 8: Comparison to other photodynamics code

`derivatives/`: Figures 2, 3, and 4: Example of multiplanet transit light curves and the derivative light curves.

`inference/`: Synthetic data generators

`inference/likelihood_profile`: Figures 9 and 10: Likelihood profiles

`inference/mcmc`: Figure 11: MCMC runs and timing comparisons between sampling methods
